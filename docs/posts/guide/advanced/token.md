# Token
Online P2P exchanges between Motor Nodes have zero tolls. Outlined are some methods for the Sonr Utility Token.

*   **Swapping** - Highway nodes that facilitate swaps from Sonr Token for ETH, BTC, etc. earn Token.

*   **Maintenance** - Deployed Highway nodes earn Token for helping regulate the network

*   **Offline Exchanges** - Motor Nodes pay a Toll when interacting with offline peers, or storing data in long term.

# Tokenomics

🚧 Work in Progress

The Sonr team is currently working with [Prysm Group](https://www.prysmgroup.io/) to design a robust tokenomics model to foster and reward activity on the Sonr network. This model will include mechanisms around: 

1. Governance 
2. Staking 
3. Exchange
4. Swapping
5. Validator rewards 

Contact the Sonr team for more details on our tokenomics design.
