> Sonr is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and manage their own decentralized identity.

# Blockchain: Sonr

Sonr stores Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on its Cosmos-sdk based blockchain. The blockchain's role is to act as the
persistent pointer store for locations of User owned data.

# User Key Vault: Motr

The Motr node is a service-worker which functions as a personal encrypted key-enclave for users stored on IPFS. They can be allocated and persisted on the
Sonr blockchain for Smart Wallet functionality.

# Network Gateway: Hway

The Hway protocol is a network proxy which routes network requests to the appropriate service endpoint. This is used for seamless communication between
Blockchain Nodes, Decentralized Applications, and User Nodes.

# Design System: Nebula

Built with Golang-Templ, TailwindCSS, HTMX, and Service Workers - Nebula is a component library which allows for
consistent UX across the entire ecosystem.
