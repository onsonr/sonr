# Introduction

Sonr is a decentralized identity network built on the Cosmos-sdk. It has early origins as a peer-to-peer file sharing network, but has since evolved into a platform for decentralized authentication and authorization. The early lessons taught from our file sharing roots are used as our theology for building the Sonr Blockchain.

## Principles

1. Bitcoin is digital gold
2. Blockchains are programmable databases with functional operations
3. Staking is essentially a savings account
4. The Sonr Network conducts all operations in the $SNR token
5. Service Delegation subsidizes user wallet operations.
6. Cryptocurrency has the potential to break the software innovation ceiling

## The Problem

Centralized identity has led to internet monopolies abusing your trust and privacy.

## The Solution

A peer-to-peer system for decentralized personal identity with Authentication and Authorization capabilities.

## What is Sonr?

A privacy preserving, identity system managed by user controlled decentralized vaults which have the flexibility of
software wallets with the security of hardware wallets.

## The End Goal

A Data sharing economy where human-specific information has intrinsic value. Services are incentivized to act in
good faith in order to obtain quality user data.

## How do we do it?
