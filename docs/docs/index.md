# Introduction

Sonr is a decentralized identity network built on the Cosmos-sdk. It has early origins as a peer-to-peer file sharing network, but has since evolved into a platform for decentralized authentication and authorization. The early lessons taught from our file sharing roots are used as our theology for building the Sonr Blockchain.
