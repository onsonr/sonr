# Introduction

Sonr is a decentralized identity network built on the Cosmos-sdk. It has early origins as a peer-to-peer file sharing network, but has since evolved into a platform for decentralized authentication and authorization. The early lessons taught from our file sharing roots are used as our theology for building the Sonr Blockchain.

## Principles

1. Bitcoin is digital gold
2. Blockchains are programmable databases with functional operations
3. Staking is essentially a savings account
4. The Sonr Network conducts all operations in the $SNR token
5. Service Delegation subsidizes user wallet operations.
6. Cryptocurrency has the potential to break the software innovation ceiling

## The Problem

Centralized identity has led to internet monopolies abusing your trust and privacy.

## The Solution

A peer-to-peer system for decentralized personal identity with Authentication and Authorization capabilities.

## What is Sonr?

A privacy preserving, identity system managed by user controlled decentralized vaults which have the flexibility of
software wallets with the security of hardware wallets.

## The End Goal

A Data sharing economy where human-specific information has intrinsic value. Services are incentivized to act in
good faith in order to obtain quality user data.

## How do we do it?

Provide Internet Citizens with a robust easy to use WebVault which features a crypto wallet, passkey authenticator, and encrypted messages. The WebVault serves as a wrapper over every sensitive intent-based user interaction. The Smart blockchain is responsible for keeping a record of where WebVaults are located, when authorization activity occurs, and which services are allowed over what permissions.

## The User Incentive

Data is the byproduct of currency exchange in the Information age. Meaning services pay other services for user data or profits in order to enrich their database with complete user personas.
