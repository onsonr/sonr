# Light Client Implementation

## 🚧 Under Construction

Sonr is building a blockchain ecosystem where users have full control over their digital identity, and developers are empowered to build peer-to-peer decentralized applications. The Sonr network is collectively made up of motor nodes, which act as clients and represent end-users, and highway nodes, the Sonr network’s servers for data transmission.

* **Real-time peer-to-peer network:** To enable cross-device discovery, delivery, and transmission, Sonr leverages the `LibP2P` framework. With `LibP2P` nodes in the Sonr network can dial other nodes in the network to exchange messages using various transports, like QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, and Bluetooth. Nodes can run on any device, as a cloud service, mobile application or in the browser and talk to each other as long as they are connected on the Sonr network.
* **Verifiable user identity:** Sonr enables verifiable on-chain identity via its decentralized-identity enabled blockchain. Access to this experience is unlocked via procurement of a .snr subdomain. This subdomain gives users one central point for gaining and granting access to user data.

This peer-to-peer network and identity-enabled blockchain combine to makeup the user-owned internet experience that is Sonr.

### **How Sonr solves the digital ownership problem**

With the described solution, Sonr introduces a new digital ownership paradigm where users can securely control access to their personal data, through their .snr/ domain. To enable this, each .snr/ domain is resolved as a decentralized identity on the Sonr blockchain. Let’s say Prad secures the prad.snr/ subdomain. If he wants to access Netflicks, a blockchain-based movie recommendation platform built on the Sonr blockchain, he can access his data at prad.snr/Netflicks and also grant other users and applications access to his data. With Sonr we put power and control over personal data into the hands of users.
