# Security Token Offering (STO)

These security tokens represent ownership of assets, profit-sharing rights, or other financial instruments, and they are subject to securities regulations in various jurisdictions. Unlike utility tokens offered in ICOs, security tokens have legal backing, making them a more regulated and compliant way to raise funds for blockchain projects.

## **Adoption Rate**

&#x20;STOs emerged as a more regulated and investor-friendly alternative to ICOs. They gained attention as a means to address regulatory concerns and provide greater investor protection. While STOs have garnered interest and are seen as a more compliant option for token sales, their adoption rate has been slower compared to ICOs and other token sale mechanisms due to the complex regulatory process in registering tokens as securities.

## **Timing**

&#x20;STOs are typically conducted when a project aims to raise funds by offering tokens that are classified as securities. The timing may vary, but it often occurs when the project has a clear regulatory-compliant plan and is ready to engage with institutional and accredited investors.

## **Initiator of the Sale**

The STO is initiated by the project team seeking to raise funds through the issuance of security tokens. The team must comply with relevant securities laws and regulations during the entire process.

## **Flow of Funds**

&#x20;During an STO, funds are raised from investors who purchase security tokens. These funds are typically received in the form of fiat currency or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The project receives the raised funds and is expected to use them for the development and operation of the project in a manner consistent with the offering's terms and regulatory requirements.

## **Who Can Invest**

&#x20;STOs are generally open to accredited investors and institutional investors. Accredited investors are individuals or entities that meet certain financial criteria defined by regulatory authorities. The criteria may include minimum income or net worth thresholds. Institutional investors can also participate, subject to compliance with relevant regulations.

## **Decentralization**

While STOs are generally seen as more regulated and compliant compared to ICOs, the level of decentralization can vary among projects conducting STOs. Some projects may maintain a certain degree of centralization in terms of governance, control, or token distribution, while others aim to maintain a high level of decentralization despite regulatory compliance. The focus on decentralization in STOs is often related to ensuring a fair and transparent distribution of security tokens and involving the community in decision-making processes.
