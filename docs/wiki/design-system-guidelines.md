## Meet Nebula

***

### **🟢 Simple**

Help users reach their goals as quickly as possible with the least amount of steps.

### 🚀 **Empowering**

Provide more opportunities for access

### ✌🏻 **Approachable**

Lean towards over-explaining rather than assuming tech knowledge

***

## **Next Steps**

* Merge Beam Figma library components with the Nebula v0.01 file
* Further develop [guidelines](https://www.notion.so/9bbeef098b804019ac18186de4e52153?pvs=21) for use in community development/outreach
