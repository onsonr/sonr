The Sonr Schema module is used to store the records of verifiable objects for a specific application powered by the Sonr Network. Schemas are used to create custom application protocols which can be asserted on in order to verify your application data. Application data uploaded can verify their data model through `Schemas`.

## Overview

Schemas are implemented on the `IPLD Object Model` which allows developers to register specific application data schemas. See [IPLD Schema documentation](https://ipld.io/docs/schemas)

## Concepts

### WhatIs records

A `WhatIs` record holds an instance of `Schema`. This document holds all metadata and relationships for the `Schema` created

```go
message WhatIs {
// DID is the DID of the object
string did

// Object_doc is the object document
SchemaDefinition schema

// Creator is the DID of the creator
string creator

// Timestamp is the time of the last update of the DID Document
int64 timestamp

// IsActive is the status of the DID Document
bool is_active

// collection of user defined items indended for indexing purposes
map<string,string> metadata
}
```

below is an example `WhatIs`

```json
"what_is": {
    "did": "did:snr:QmZcUASaA9J7KPDpM7NzpnhvTkdpf5t4DrKEGerKtGwKyd",
    "creator": "did:snr:1z7elmmwqem0ttd707m9sceuqlqz3w4mxqaxydf",
    "schema": {
        "label": "Profile",
        "did": "did:snr:QmZcUASaA9J7KPDpM7NzpnhvTkdpf5t4DrKEGerKtGwKyd",
        "creator": "snr1z7elmmwqem0ttd707m9sceuqlqz3w4mxqaxydf",
        "fields": [
            {
                "name": "user",
                "field_kind": {
                    "kind": "STRING"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "email",
                "field_kind": {
                    "kind": "STRING"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "timestamp",
                "field_kind": {
                    "kind": "INT"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "lastSeen",
                "field_kind": {
                    "kind": "INT"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "message",
                "field_kind": {
                    "kind": "INT"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "isOnline",
                "field_kind": {
                    "kind": "INT"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "timestamp": 1663184793,
    "is_active": true
}
```

Currently a schema cannot be modified once it has been created. To Modify A Schema, create a new Schema.

### Schema Definition

A `Schema` is used to describe an application Schema that will be stored for later assertion against. The provided `Schema` is then used to derive the `WhatIs` that will be recorded on chain. Schemas comply to the `IPLD Object` specification.

```go
// Schema is the root level document of a schema, stored on chain
message Schema {
// the DID of the schema
string did = 1;

// the address of the owner
string owner = 2;

// the name of the schema
string label = 3;

// list of fields the schema contains
repeated SchemaField fields = 4;

// list of metadata
repeated MetadataDefintion metadata = 5;
}
```

---

### Schema Fields

Schema's declare the intended type of a property though IPLD Type `KIND`. Each `KIND` is mapped to the name of a property. Each property defined must map to one of the given `IPLD KINDS`

Kinds contained within the `SchemaField` are described below:
Each field represents a `IPLD` Kind. More information can be found [here](https://ipld.io/docs/schemas/features/typekinds/).

We currently support the following `types`, and are working to comply with the full `IPLD` type system to support types beyond those listed.

```go
LIST
BOOL
INT
FLOAT
STRING
BYTES
LINK
```

The following are the numeric values which are used in our `protocol` layers.

| Kind    | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| List    | 0     |
| Boolean | 1     |
| Integer | 2     |
| Float   | 3     |
| String  | 4     |
| Bytes   | 5     |
| Link    | 6     |

# `Link` types and combining Schemas

A `Link` refers to a schema by `DID` which allows users to reuse schemas as properties on other schema definitions. Here we will model a simple schema with nested content.

**Example**

```json
"foo": {
    "kind": 6,
    "link_did": <DID>
}
```

`Link` is a `DID` pointing to the following schema

```json
{
  "bar": {
    "kind": 4
  }
}
```

Below is an `Object` using the schema with the **foo** field defined above:

```json
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": "hello-world"
  }
}
```

# Schema Item Kinds

a `SchemaKindDefinition` may contain an optional `SchemaItemKind` which expresses a type present within a collection. Currently there is only a single collection type `List`.
A `SchemaItemKindDefinition` is not required, except if a list is to contain a `Link` which a item definition must be provided (see above examples for creating a link definition)

## Example Item definition

Below is a SchemaDefinition with a single field, which defines a collection of attributes, it expresses it's type as a `List` containing `string` items

`Schema`

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "kind": "LIST",
    "list_kind": {
      "kind": "STRING"
    }
  }
}
```

`Definition`

```json
{
  "attributes": ["interesting", "curious", "brave", "insightful"]
}
```

## Nesting Lists with Item Kind Definitions

multi dimensional lists can be expressed using item definitions, below is an example of a two dimensional list of integers. When explicitly definining item kinds, a max depth of 3 dimensions is allowed.

```json
"attributes": {
    "kind": "LIST",
    "list_kind": {
        "kind": "LIST",
        "list_kind": {
            "kind": "INT"
        }
    }
}
```

```json
{
  "level": [
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
  ]
}
```

### Examples

The following are example Schemas and [Objects](/docs/intro/modules/documents.md) which outline how types declared within a schema map to the objects which are defined from them. Below are two examples: An `User Status`, and a `Pet`.

The following is an example schema for a `User Status`

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "user",
      "field_kind": {
        "kind": "STRING"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "email",
      "field_kind": {
        "kind": "STRING"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "timestamp",
      "field_kind": {
        "kind": "INT"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "lastSeen",
      "field_kind": {
        "kind": "STRING"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "message",
      "field_kind": {
        "kind": "STRING"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "isOnline",
      "field_kind": {
        "kind": "BOOL"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Below is a user status object defined by the above schema

```json
{
  "username": "snr1d8cjuwkssr9uzf8zllkmmn0ekv6p7a7yuz2dp",
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "timestamp": 1662057099,
  "lastSeen": 1661220968,
  "message": "This is my email!",
  "isOnline": true
}
```

The following is an example schema for a `Pet`

##### Schema

```json
{
    "name": STRING,
    "breed": STRING,
    "age": INT,
    "owner": STRING
}
```

Below is a pet object defined by the above schema

##### Object

```json
{
  "name": "Cleo",
  "breed": "Domestic-Short-Hair",
  "age": 5,
  "owner": "snr1d8cjuwkssr9uzf8zllkmmn0ekv6p7a7yuz2dpc"
}
