# $SNR Token

The price of a token is the exchange rate of the token for fiat. The value of the token can be modeled in terms of fundamental demand drivers and effective supply. The demand of the token is driven by the property rights granted by the token, and the effective supply is driven by the number of tokens to which a specific set of rights are granted.

## 1. Introduction

Existing mechanisms for user identity with their lack of standardization have led to faulty solutions that source information from closed third-party sources. By introducing a new peer-to-peer network we solve this issue at the point of the device and leverage a blockchain system to verify User claims.

Sonr provides the utility of managing crypto assets, private identifiable information, and application specific data while having full W3C Decentralized Identifier compliance.

## 2. Distribution

A rudimentary draft on the Sonr Token Allocation, Distribution, and Release strategies from the initial work done in collaboration with [Prysm Group](https://prysmgroup.io).

### Team and Investors

The initial pool of tokens to be distributed to the team and investors is 2,000,000,000 SNR. This pool will be distributed as follows:

| Segment Distribution | Allocation | Tokens ($SNR) | Distribution at Launch | Periodic Distribution | Distribution Lock-Up Months | Vesting Months |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Community            | 50.00%     | 1,000,000,000 | See Below              | See Below             | See Below                   | See Below      |

### Community Breakdown

After launch the community portion of the token distribution will be distributed as follows:

| Segment Portion               | Allocation | Tokens (SNR) | Amount at Launch | Start Date | Initial Size | Growth Rate (YTD) | SNR Remaining |

## 3. Payments

The Sonr modules are the core building blocks for creating decentralized, privacy-preserving, and user orientated apps. Each module corresponds with an associated blockchain keeper which allows developers to perform the inputed action.

### Registry

The registry module houses our standard for User and Application identification. We utilize the combined encryption technology native to the user’s devices to secure their identity effectively on the internet without the use of passwords and seed phrases.

- **Creating a User**
- **Modifying User Account**
- **Registering an Application**
- **Updating Application Settings**
- **Buying an Alias**
- **Listing an Alias for Sale**
- **Transferring an Alias**

### Schema

The schema module records all the type definitions in a particular application powered by the Sonr Network. It provides a reliable way for nodes to be able to resolve and utilize data types across the network in a verifiable and decentralized way.

- **Defining a Schema**
- **Updating a Schema**
- **Deleting a Schema**
- **Classify Schema into NFT Collection**
- **Modifying the Schema Classification**
- **Minting NFT from Schema**
- **Burning Existing NFTs**
- **Updating a User’s NFT Properties**

### Bucket

The bucket module handles the records of all IPFS based encrypted storage folders that interact with nodes across the network. This includes serving Key Vaults, reading/writing to App Buckets, and sending messages to Mailboxes.

- **Generating a App, Mailbox, or Vault Bucket**
- **Updating a Buckets Settings**
- **Deleting a Bucket**

## 4. Staking

The clear path for the underlying application for staking is utilizing a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) validation mechanism. Down the line Sonr will provide IPFS storage nodes, and governance participation in the staking model.

<Note>
Demand = Obtain rewards, goods, or services through staking or locking up the token.
</Note>

<Note>
Supply = Tokens staked or locked up.
</Note>

On Sonr we will be leveraging a **delegate stake** mechanism in order to **optimize buy-in** for users in the network. It imposes an **excess opportunity cost** if **slashing** is implemented.

With this being said, there are some challenges in implementing staking:

- The token must already have value
- Allocating power or influence via staking gives major edge to wealthy users
- They are frequently subject to gaming and coordination problems

However there is substantial benefit in incorporating a staking mechanism, with the following criteria met we can create a sustainable design:

1. The upfront capital required to stake should not significantly discourage them to stake
2. If a stakeholder group is making decisions that materially harm the network, they would be punished via slashing the stake.
3. Stakeholders can make decisions that positively impact the future network health and token price, therefore holding stake can promote positive Sonr growth

### Validator Nodes for Cosmos ASB

Sonr is a Cosmos powered blockchain which is powered by a TenderMint validation mechanism. The default consensus for TenderMint is DPoS and works with our current ABCI implementation for Transaction Verification. DPoS is a twist on Proof of Stake consensus that relies upon a group of delegates to validate blocks on behalf of all nodes in the network . Witnesses are elected by stakeholders at a rate of one vote per share per witness . Coin age is irrelevant. All coins that are mature will add the same staking weight (usually 1 in the wallet hover display) Results in stable, consistent interest only for active wallets and only with small inputs.

### IPFS Storage Nodes (excluding FileCoin)

When deploying standalone highway nodes, requiring minimum stake would be an additional method to enforce availability requirements. By having a stake we can ensure that the user deploying a node has a base level of buy-in within the ecosystem.

### Governance Participants

We will be incorporating a similar strategy to AlgoRand in our governance rollout. This is covered more extensively in the [Governance](https://www.notion.so/Governance-af1251b1b7aa41fab16c53dd9fe6ef63) section.

## 5. Governance


The Demand is rooted from participation in the governance process, determining upgrades to the protocol or allocation of resources, and supply is the result of the tokens eligible to participate in the governance process.
On Sonr we will be leveraging a **delegate stake** mechanism in order to **optimize buy-in** for users in the network. It imposes an **excess opportunity cost** if **slashing** is implemented.

**Seven elements of economic design for governance**

1. Scope of Decisions
2. Stakeholders
3. Policy Research & Development
4. Proposal Process
5. Information Distribution Systems
6. Decision Making Procedures
7. Implementation & Property Rights

### Yearly Governance Cycle

- Two General Elections for proposals yearly
- Proposals need at least 20% of all validator approval to move into general election
- 51% of General Vote required for proposal to pass
- Emergency Voting sessions can be called if requested by 51% of Governance Participants

### First Rollout Phase

These are the measures the core Sonr team will be undertaking prior and during test-net deployment.

1. Establish Community

Build a loyal community of token holders that represent our platforms stakeholder groups.

- All of our existing token holders (this includes our founder and early investors) will be staking their Sonr Token in order to be incentivized to hold tokens and participate in voting
- We will be actively networking with DeFi projects, blockchain service providers, and etc. in order to participate

1. Build Dashboards

We are under the process of creating a [dashboard](https://sonrscan.io) in order to provide key metrics to our stakeholders

- **Technology**: Pricing, total fees paid, total storage used, uptime
- **Governance**: Identities, proposal outcomes, community participation

2. Polling System

Our initial polling system will be token weighted and not enforceable, in order to build engagement.

- Users will submit qualitative updates to the system and have them up/downvoted
- The core team will then assess the submissions and select viable community suggestions into upgrades
  - Along side this, our team will locate and commission the development of a proposal for any technical upgrades without enforceable code proposals
  - We will be able to provide clarity, external security, and in applicable cases the economic evaluation from the impacts of proposals to the community.

### Second Rollout Phase
Phase 2 will be underway in the months prior to main-net deployment, along with an extensive security audit.

**On-Chain Execution**: We will be introducing an on-chain, executable code-based governance system in stages with majority rule voting.

1. **Grants Program**

- Incorporate community voting for grant recipient selection
- Allow users to submit proposals for grant allocation

2. **Subsidies and Rewards**

- Proposals to update subsidies and rewards can be submitted by Core Sonr Team or third parties
- Core Team will be responsible for considering funding security, and economic audits for proposals

3. **Technical Upgrades**

- These include pricing, security, and bug fixes
- Proposals will be spearheaded by the Sonr Team and/or its delegates

### Maintenance

When on-chain governance has come to fruition, the core Sonr team will be also maintaining the polling-based system with subsidized development to minimize barrier to entry. This will be incorporating governance within the Motor Nebula Widget itself.


---

## 6. Rewards

In order to maximize buy-in and network availability for the Sonr ecosystem, we will be implementing an empirical Token Rewards mechanism. Rewards are a way to create inflation in order to dilute the token value, resulting in an affordable onboarding and operational experience for the end user. The goal behind Sonr Token rewards is to subsidize Highway based computation, in order to promote value creation and platform growth.

### Highway Services

The Sonr Highway system provides various services to interface over the blockchain records for: Schema, and Buckets. We are planning to incorporate rewards for relaying traffic, handling off-chain computation, and peer routing.

### Governance Participation

At the time of Main-net launch, phase one of the Sonr governance rollout will be implemented and will result in a set of rewards for participants.

**Submission of Proposals**

Users will be incentivized to submit blockchain improvement or grant proposals to be reviewed by voting participants. In order to prevent game from low quality and out of scope proposals, a clear-cut submission and evaluation process will be put into place on a public facing FAQ website.

- Proposers are required to stake before submission — _“Application Fee”_

**Proposal Voting**

In order to prevent innovation from halting on the Sonr ecosystem, we incentivize all staked users to participate in the polling process for community submitted proposals. Users are then rewarded for good-faith participation in voting, while also sustaining momentum.

- Existing Stakeholders are rewarded for good-faith participation in voting
