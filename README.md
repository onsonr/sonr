## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Sonr aims to be the most immersive and powerful DWeb experience for both Users and Developers alike. We believe the best way to onboard the next billion users is to create a cohesive end-to-end platform that’s composable and interoperable with all existing protocols.

For a more in-depth technical look into the Sonr ecosystem please refer to the [Architecture Decision Records](./docs/architecture/GUIDE.md).


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
