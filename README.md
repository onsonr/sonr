<br />

Sonr is a combination of decentralized primitives. Fundamentally, it is a peer-to-peer identity and asset management system that leverages DID documents, Webauthn, and IPFSâ€”providing users with a secure, portable decentralized identity.

<br />

## Components

### `sonrd`

The main blockchain node that runs the `sonr` chain. It is responsible for maintaining the state of the chain, including IPFS based vaults, and did documents.

### `vault`

The `vault` is a wasm module that is compiled and deployed to IPFS on behalf of the user. It is responsible for storing and retrieving encrypted data.

- SQLite Database backend
- Encryption via admonition
- Authentication via webauthn
- Authorization via Macroons
- HTTP API

## Acknowledgements

Sonr would not have been possible without the direct and indirect support of the following individuals:

- **Juan Benet**: For the IPFS Ecosystem.
- **Satoshi Nakamoto**: For Bitcoin.
- **Steve Jobs**: For User first UX.
- **Tim Berners-Lee**: For the Internet.
